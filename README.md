Now that you have PySpark up and running, we will show you how to execute an end-to-end customer segmentation project using the library. 

Customer segmentation is a marketing technique companies use  to identify and group users who display similar characteristics. For instance, if you visit Starbucks only during the summer to purchase cold beverages, you can be segmented as a “seasonal shopper” and enticed with special promotions curated for  the summer season.

Data scientists usually build unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as K-Means clustering or hierarchical clustering to perform customer segmentation. These models are great at identifying similar patterns between user groups that often go unnoticed by the human eye.

In this tutorial, we will use K-Means clustering to perform customer segmentation on the e-commerce dataset we downloaded earlier.
